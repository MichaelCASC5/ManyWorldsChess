Michael Calle - Many Worlds Chess

*** HOW TO LAUNCH ***

    It's very easy. Go the command line, navigate to the directory the program resides in, and enter the command: javac *.java;java Driver.java
    This will compile and execute the code. Please note that you will need Java installed to be able to do this.

*** DESCRIPTION ***

    The purpose of this program is to play with the idea of a quantum Chess game. Although my understanding of the theory of quantum physics is not the strongest, I created this program with this in mind:

        1. There is a curtain, a veil, that separates you and the Chessboard from the observation of the opponent.
        2. During your move, the veil shuts and the opponent cannot observe you nor the board. For the opponent, the board exists in a superposition of all possible next moves from the previous state of the board.
        3. After you have moved your piece, the veil opens, and the opponent can now observe what your move is. The wave function, previously in a superposition of all possible next Chessboards, now collapses due to an external observation. Only one potential next move out of many can actually actualize, and the opponent sees your move and begins their turn.
            However, as by the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, we ought not to think of one possibility actualizing, but all of them actualizing, just in separate timelines, or "worlds."
        
            In this program, the idea is that all possible "next moves" actualize, and the players play on multiple different Chessboards that exist as separate branches of timelines in one greater "tree" of previous Chessboard states. However, for the sake of simplicity, entertainment, and the consideration of computational power, I have adjusted the scenario. Instead of all possible "next moves" actualizing, we can imagine that before the veil is shut between you and the opponent, you disclose the *one* piece you will be considering in your move. Then for the opponent, the Chessboard only exists in a superposition of all possible "next moves" for that one piece, which will result in significantly less possible outcomes than if all pieces on the board were considered.
        
        ...

        1. For you, the player with the Chessboard behind the veil that separates you from the opponent, there is no superposition. You are observing and interacting with the Chessboard and are entangled with it, as it is with you. By observing the state of the Chessboard I can deduce your own state, and by observing your state, I can deduce the state of the Chessboard. The opponent on the other side of the veil cannot do this, and for that reason the Chessboard exists in a state of quantum superposition only to that opponent.

        ...

        1. This program is a work in progress. For that reason the two users, upon moving a piece, must also go the extra step and let the computer know what all possible next states for any one piece are. One day the computer will do this automatically and the players will only be required to move one piece per Chessboard at a time, but right now that is not possible.
